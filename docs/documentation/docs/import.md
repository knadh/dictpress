dictpress comes with a built in CSV to database importer tool. Once dictionary data has been organised into
the below described structure, import it by running `./dictpress import --file=yourfile.csv`.

Entries with the same content in the same language are not inserted into the database multiple times, but are instead re-used.
For instance, if there are multiple `Apple (English)` entries, it is inserted once but re-used in multiple relations.

## Sample CSV format
```csv
-,A,Apple,english,Optional note,english,"",optional-tag1|tag2,"ˈæp.əl|aapl","","{""etym"": ""ml""}"
^,"","round, red or yellow, edible fruit of a small tree",english,"","","","","",noun,""
^,"","the tree, cultivated in most temperate regions.",english,"","","","","",noun,""
^,"","il pomo.",italian,"","","","","",sost,""
-,A,Application,english,Optional note,italian,"","","aplɪˈkeɪʃ(ə)n","",""
^,"","the act of putting to a special use or purpose",english,"","","","","",noun,""
^,"","le applicazione",italian,"","","","","",sost,""

```

Every line in the CSV file contains an entry in a given language described in 10 columns.
Each entry is either a main entry in the dictionary, or a definition of another entry.
This is indicated by the first column in each line. `-` represents a main entry and all subsequent
entries below it marked with `^` represents its definitions in one or more languages.

The above example shows two main English entries, "Apple" and "Application" with multiple
English and Italian definitions below them.

| 1      | initial           | The uppercase first character of the entry. Eg: `A` for Apple.

One or more parts-of-speech types separated by `\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `. Example `noun\ | verb`. |
